Hey there! :wave:

I'm a Games & Multimedia graduate with experience in 3D Character Art!

I'm currently enrolled in a programming course at :four::two:, coding in C and C++. Every repository starting with "42-cursus" is part of the curriculum.

If you want to chat, reach me at bcmonico@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by. :sunglasses:

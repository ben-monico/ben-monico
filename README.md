Hello, my name is Bernardo MÃ³nico and I'm currently studying programming.

I graduated in Games & Multimedia at IPL - ESTG and worked as a 3D Character Artist for a couple years. Only later did I give a try to programming and I'm really enjoying it.

I'm currently enrolled in a programming course at 42 Lisboa, in which I start by learning C and C++. Later, I'll have to choose a subject to specialize on.

Every repository starting with "42-cursus" is a project I had/have to deliver as a student at 42.

If you need to message me feel free to email me: bcmonico@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by. ðŸ‘‹
